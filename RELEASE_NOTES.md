## 🚀 What's New

### 👥 Multi-User & Multi-Session Support
- **Google Login (OAuth 2.0)**: Individual accounts now have their own secure sessions.
- **WhatsApp Multi-Client**: Multiple users can connect their own WhatsApp accounts simultaneously. The system uses session persistence to keep you logged in.
- **Improved UI Layout**: Switched to a modern tab-based design ('My Tasks' vs 'Other Tasks') for better task management.

### ⚡ Performance & Reliability
- **Neon DB Optimization**: Implemented in-memory caching and optimized connection pooling to allow the database to sleep during idle periods, saving resources.
- **Log Rotation**: Integrated `lumberjack.v2` for daily log rotation and automatic 7-day retention to prevent disk overflow on the VPS.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: Fully containerized setup for easy scaling and deployment on any VPS.

### 🛠 Fixes & Refinements
- **UI Polish**: Updated to a sleek dark theme with glassmorphism effects.
- **Soft Delete**: Tasks are now archived rather than permanently deleted, allowing for recovery and export.
- **Error Handling**: Improved backend error reporting with transparent JSON responses.
